Expo Tutorial: Developing Your First Android and iOS App on macOS

This tutorial will guide you through the process of developing your first mobile app using Expo. Expo is a powerful platform for building cross-platform mobile applications using React Native. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to set up Expo, create a new project, and build a simple app for both Android and iOS.

Prerequisites:

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed on your macOS system:

* Node.js and npm
* Expo CLI
* Xcode (for iOS development)
* Android Studio (for Android development)

 Getting Started
  
  Follow these steps to start developing your first Expo app:

1 - Install Expo CLI globally using npm:

```Copy code
npm install -g expo-cli
```

2 - Create a new Expo project: 

```copy code
expo init AwesomeProject
Navigate into your project directory:
```
```Copy code
cd AwesomeProject
Start the development server:
```

```Copy code
npm start
```

Follow the instructions to run your app on an Android or iOS emulator, or scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your device.

Building Your App
Once your project is set up, you can start building your app by editing the JavaScript files in the src directory. Expo provides a variety of pre-built components and APIs to help you create rich mobile experiences.
